-- Background:(WINDOWING FUNCTIONS with CTEs or Subqueries)
-- You have been hired by BYU-I Air to help sort through the airportdb database. 
-- Each week you will receive a file from your manager with questions that 
-- need answered by writing queries against the database. 
-- This week your manager wants you to understand what windowing functions are. 
-- One point for a CTE or Subquery version of the query, Two points for both. 
-- Cannot use AI to convert one to the other for points.
-- Cannot use AI for a complete solution.
-- Appropriate use of AI is having it teach you about the concepts and then you write the queries.
