-- 5. List the number of passengers each flight serviced within the U.S.
--    Sort by total number of passengers from greatest to least
--    The activity column consists of a case statement with the

--    formatted with the following:
--    - Dollar sign
--    - Comma at the thousands place
--    - Rounded to 2 decimal places
